abstract = {We describe a distributed position-based network protocol optimized for minimum energy consumption in mobile wireless networks that support peer-to-peer communications. Given any number of randomly deployed nodes over an area, we show that a simple local optimization scheme executed at each node guarantees strong connectivity of the entire network and attains the global minimum energy solution for the stationary case. Due to its localized nature, this protocol proves to be self-reconfiguring and stays close to the minimum energy solution when applied to the case of mobile nodes. Our simulations verify its performance},
annote = {Nodes pairs are associated with 'relay regions', which are the nodes around the sender which are more energy efficient to send through than directly to the receiver.  The 'enclosure' of a node is then defined as all of the relay regions it can reach.  The protocol establishes a sub-network that will require less power and has fewer nodes for reaching some destination.  This is accomplished by first creating a sparse graph representing all of the enclosures in each transmitting node in the network, which is done through local computation.  This graph contains globally optimal links (in terms of energy), which are then fed into a distributed Bellmann-Ford algorithm with power consumption as the cost metric.  This algorithm is self-configuring and can respond to failures and mobile nodes.  It was originally designed for mobile p2p networks, but is highly applicable to sensor networks as well.},

abstract = {Wireless ad hoc networks are becoming increasingly important in today's world. The most challenging problem in conjunction with ad hoc networks is routing, i.e., the procedure in charge of determining the trajectory of packets traveling over the network. For large-scale ad hoc networks scalability of the routing approach is extremely important. One of the approaches to scale up ad hoc routing is geographical location based routing, which usually requires all nodes to be aware of their exact locations. In this paper, a new routing algorithm is proposed which requires only a subset of nodes to know their exact location forming location areas around these nodes. This paper outlines the LABAR (Location Area Based Ad Hoc Routing) routing protocol and provides simulation measurements on its average routing distance compared to the optimum shortest path.},

Other nodes belong to the zone surrounding one of these G-nodes.
They assume the same location as the nearby G-node, but may be a few hops away.

        
The virtual backbone is formed by a root G-node sending messages to nearby zones until all are a part of the virtual backbone.

        
G-nodes translate IP addresses to geographic locations, determines a vector towards the destination, and instructs the source node how to route the message to a nearby zone closest to this vector.
If this forwarding fails, the source is notified and the packet is forwarded along the backbone.},

abstract = {A key design issue in routing for wireless ad hoc networks is scalability. By scalability we mean the ability of the network to support increases in node numbers without significantly degrading network performance. In this work we introduce a new hybrid wireless routing protocol specifically designed to address this issue. Our new protocol combines features of reactive routing with location-based geographic routing, in such a manner so as to efficiently use all the location information available. The protocol is designed to gracefully exit to reactive routing as the location information degrades. Another aspect of our protocol is that it can be spatially dependent - meaning different physical areas of the network can be using quite different routing procedures at the same epoch. That our protocol can dramatically increase scalability can be measured via the routing control overhead which we show, through analysis and simulation, to be significantly reduced relative to current protocols. This is particularly so when a large fraction of nodes possess up-to-date accurate location information. Our new protocol operates even though nodes can be mobile, and it provides an enhanced, yet pragmatic, location-enabled solution that can be deployed in all emerging wireless ad hoc networks.},

address = {New York, NY, USA},
annote = {Uses a routing technique similar to Cartesian routing in which each node maintains a list of neighbors, found through periodically broadcasted HELLO packets, and forwards a message to the neighbor known to be closest to the destination.
The HELLO messages are broadcast one hop away to extend local neighborhood knowledge.
They do not consider voids in the network.

        
Each node maintains its location in a number of location servers, which are other nodes in the network.
Location servers' locations are more dense near a node and less dense farther away to decrease inefficiencies for lookups made nearer to the node.

        
Geographic space is divided up into hierarchical square regions (each order-2 square is comprised of 4 order-1 squares, the smallest, and so on).
At each level of this hierarchy, a node is chosen as a server within each of the 3 order-i squares external to the one the source node resides in but contained within the order-i+1 square the source resides in. 
The servers are chosen by having an ID closest to the source's, but greater (the ID space is circular).
This is done by initially forwarding the packet to a particular location that the source wants a location server in.
The message is then forwarded locally until the appropriate node within that region is found.
The bootstrapping process involves first finding the order-1 servers, then order-2, etc.

        
Note that a message should never travel farther than the size of the smallest square in which source and destination are co-located.
In fact, each lookup only takes n steps where the order-n square is the smallest square that source and destination are co-located in.

        
Each step in the lookup process brings the query to the best node in the next larger square.

        
          
Updating location information
        
Each node sends updated information (outside the order-1 square since those are immediate neighbors) periodically.
The number of updates is proportional to the node's speed.

        
To handle query failures due to nodes leaving a region, forwarding pointers are left behind.
These pointers are piggy-backed on the HELLO messages.},

geographic models: [9,16]
[9] divides into square zones
[16] just sends to intermediary closest to destination node

        
GRID is reactive.
Geographic region divided into logical grids, each a square, with an elected leader of each grid.
Avoids broadcast storm since only the leader of each grid handles routing (density-agnostic).

        
NOTE: as \#grids approaches \#hosts, it's back to normal flooding!

        
          
Grids
        
Each grid is same size: chosen based on transmission range and whether source in a grid can talk to 4 or 8 of the neighboring grids, with destination gateways in center or anywhere in those grids.
There is a trade-off between the sizes as too big will make it hard to reach the next grid neighbor whereas too small results in higher overhead and a decreased probability of a node being available to fill a gateway position.

        
          
Routing
        
Zone-based version of AODV.
RREQs have a range parameter to define search area.
They can also be confined by 4 shapes: rectangle, bar from S to D with some width, fan with angle and radius, overlap of 2 fans.

        
          
Gateways
        
Chosen as node closest to center of zone.
Remains a gateway until leaving zone.
If a node hasn't heard from a gateway in a while, it will broadcast a packet: the gateway replies if still there and other nodes that are closer to center reply so that after some time a new gateway is chosen if the old one left.
Because broadcast is unreliable, if two gateways exist, one will silently step down when it hears a GATE packet from a closer gateway.
GATE packets every 10 seconds.

look at [4]: location in cellular paging
[19]: location routing in BS radios

        
          
Assumptions
        
Assumes GPS is free from error
Destination (D) assumed to be in some circular region, whose radius is defined based on D's velocity, which is assumed known to all nodes.

        
          
Route requests
        
Route request  only forwarded if node is within expected zone, so other zones are added to fill gap between S and D's zones: request zones.
Failed request (such as peers residing outside of the tear-drop shaped expected zones) recover by simply flooding the whole network.

        
          
2 algorithms for determining node's zone
1) Draw a minimum sized rectangle to include the expected zone circle and S
2) Only forward if node is closer than the previous node + $\backslash$delta, where $\backslash$delta is a configurable parameter (0 in their simulations) to avoid local maximums.

        
          
Simulation
        
Simple random walk models, no waiting in between, varied speeds and distances.
No transmission errors, or channel contention.
Increased error seems to have little effect on \# routing packets sent per data packet: likely due to increasing expected zone size for higher error.

        
          
Optimizations
        
Larger request zones, gradually increasing request zone size after failures.
Adapting request zone at intermediate nodes if they have better info about location.
Propagating speed/location information by piggybacking on other packets.
Intermediate nodes detecting route failures can initialize a local search to decrease request zone size.

Use greedy forwarding, but to address holes in the network they use a learned cost function of forwarding to the destination for each neighbor.  Once packet reaches the target region, the data is diffused through either recursive geographic forwarding or restricted flooding.  The latter is better in less dense networks.

They proposed, in an IETF RFC, geographic routers, geographic multi-cast, and a Domain Name System approach.

        
Regions defined as points, circles, or polygons consisting of points.

        
3 main components:
GeoRouter - routes packets, is responsible for some region
GeoNode - handles storing/forwarding data to the smaller region it is responsible for
GeoHost - the actual process running on end hosts

        
Routers use a caching mechanism with timeouts indexed by H(message\_id).
Routers determine their service area by finding the convex hull of all the children's service areas, which are polygons, in order to avoid inefficiencies introduced by concave polygons and those with holes.
If a message is destined for an area a router doesn't serve, it forwards the message to its parent router.

        
Experimental results reveal some improvements in routing, mostly due to checking polygons' intersections.},

abstract = {This paper addresses reliability of data dissemination applications when there are severe disruptions to the underlying physical infrastructure. Such massive simultaneous physical failures can happen during the geographical events such as natural disasters (earthquakes, floods, tornados) or sudden power outages - infrastructure failures in these cases are geographically correlated. In particular, we focus on overlay based data dissemination mechanisms and explore their ability to tolerate such large geographically correlated failures. Due to the tight correlation between multiple overlay links and a single physical link, a few physical failures may affect lots of overlay links. To enable reliable dissemination under such conditions, we propose overlay network construction methods that incorporate proximity-aware neighbor selection methods to improve the performance of the overlay data dissemination, to the extent possible, in terms of reliability and latency. In this approach, the overlay nodes select neighbors which are most likely distinct in presence of a geographical failure; we show how an overlay structure constructed using our proximity-aware neighbor selection techniques can disseminate data to over 80\% of reachable end clients without any significant additional latency under various geographical failure conditions.},
